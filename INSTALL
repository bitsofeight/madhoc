Some short notes.


The kernel must support IP forwarding in the kernel to run.
This can be turned on in the file /etc/sysconfig/network under redhat, change or add the line
FORWARD_IPV4 to FORWARD_IPV4=true or type 'echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward'.

You also need to install libpcap-0.4.

Running:

Put the card in ad hoc mode with a good address, and add the net for the address.
Add the broadcast address to the interface 'route add 255.255.255.255 dev your_interface'.
Run the file with 'aodv_daemon your_interface'.

The log file is in ./logmsg.txt.
You can get some commands in the program by hitting enter.
